* Erogue

** Introduction

Erogue is a roguelike game written in Emacs Lisp intended to be played
from within emacs.

The goal of this project is to create a roguelike similar in
simplicity to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larn_%28video_game%29][Larn]] but with interesting-enough mechanics to encourage
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergent_gameplay][emergent gameplay]].

** Roadmap/TODO list
